<h1>February 5th</h1>
<h2>RUN</h2>
<p>I decided to do the repeated lines using the for loop that was talked about in the chapter 4 reading. This made sense for my verb run because it looks like the line is getting closer and closer to the finish line, so with each step it is moving forward in motion. For my color choice I chose gray to look like a sidewalk, and I chose red to be like a finish line. I chose Futura font bc duh NIKE.  </p>
