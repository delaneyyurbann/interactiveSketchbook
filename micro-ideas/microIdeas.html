<p>Interaction: As you click the black circle will get smaller and smaller, there will be lots of happy colorful dots bouncing around. </p>
<p>Intended feeling: sadness and hopeless</p><br>


<h2>Love</h2>
<p>System: This will show how love gives you the space to grow and evolve into a more beautiful version of yourself alongside someone else.</p>
<p>Interaction: 2 shapes are in some constraints (like in their own bubble or universe) but when the constraints bump into each other, the shapes come together. The shapes grow and grow and turn different colors each time you click. </p>
